No special licence. Use it as you like but keep in mind that some scripts are
not written by me and I cannot guarantee that these scripts are not licensed
under some specific licence(s).

That refers specifically to the:
  - bin/flac2mp3
  - bin/git-delete-history
  - bin/hgeditor
  - bin/unbuffer

It is possible that other things could be also licensed under some specific
licence(s).
